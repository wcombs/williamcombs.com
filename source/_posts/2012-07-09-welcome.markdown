My name is Will Combs and I like to make stuff.

I’ll define <em>stuff</em> in the scope of this site as any project that involves solving problems through the synthesis of readily available components and technologies. Basically, I’m a Linux Sysadmin by day (well, by night too), and I like to work with electronics and programming in my spare time, with the ultimate goal of making cool stuff.

I’ve found that forums, blogs, and other online communities inspire and guide many of my projects. When you are stumped on a project there is nothing more helpful than finding a detailed write-up by another hobbyist who tackled a similar challenge, and this site is my attempt at providing more write-ups like this.
