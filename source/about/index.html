This site is my attempt at sharing something back to the collective conscience that is the internet.  I've had sites in the past but left them for dead for various reasons.  My first was a classic Geocities page with crazy gifs and under contruction logos all over.  My second was a simple blog about tech projects I was working on at the time.  Life got crazy and I left those sites behind, but now I'm finding I have more stuff to share, so it's time to start it back up.  I've shyed away from *blogging* up to this point because of a dilemma I have with the inherent vanity of the activity.  I've come to realize that if I reach one person, and teach them something unique, then it's all worth it, so that will be my goal (and I'll try to contain all the self-important rantings on this page). 

*test*

__TEST__


The tools available these days to get a site up and running are numerous and amazing.  I messed with WordPress (which has come a long way) and eventually landed on OctoPress as my *CMS*.  I run a micro EC2 instance in AWS' East Coast availability zone, with CentOS as my current server distro of choice.
